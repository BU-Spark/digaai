This is a joint project with Boston University Spark! and Digaai.

It represents census data for Brazilian immigrants in America.

This uses "all_data.csv" as the main resource for data.
"all_data.csv" represents population count for various subgroups in each state.
Each column is an individual state and each row is a subgroup of Brazilian Americans.
Except for a couple at the end represent median income in each state.
The states are in alphabetical order. E.g.
  01      02      03       04       05         06      07         08         09                   10     11    12
